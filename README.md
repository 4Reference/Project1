# Project1 - The wonderful world of wine
## This is the repo for Group 2's Project 1.

In looking for a topic for this project, we originally wanted to look into beer data however we encountered difficulty in finding an available dataset or access to free and open API's.

In searching through Kaggle, we found a webscrapped dataset from wine enthusist from 2017. So we decided that the topic was similar and that we could work backwards starting with the data and determining from there where to go.

When we started thinking about wine and the questions we could ask about it, we began to wonder what types of things we could ask and try to prove from this data. We could easily identify the most/least well rated wine and/or most/least expensive but that didn't seem to be sufficent to meet the criteria set.

Most of the group didn't know anything really about wine. Trying to think of where the best wines came from the first assumption was France or Italy or California.

The question then became could we use the dataset to see if there was combination of price and professional rating to see if California had significanty better wine when compared to the rest of the world.
